# FindingClosestEvents
  
**Scenario**
  - Your program should randomly generate seed data.
  - Your program should operate in a world that ranges from -10 to +10 (Y axis), and -10 to +10 (X axis).
  - Your program should assume that each co-ordinate can hold a maximum of one event.
  - Each event has a unique numeric identifier (e.g. 1, 2, 3).
  - Each event has zero or more tickets.
  - Each ticket has a non-zero price, expressed in US Dollars.
  - The distance between two points should be computed as the Manhattan distance.
  
**Instructions**
  - You are required to write a program which accepts a user location as a pair of co- ordinates, and returns a list of the five closest events, along with the cheapest ticket price for each event.
  - Please detail any assumptions you have made.
  - How might you change your program if you needed to support multiple events at the
same location?
  - How would you change your program if you were working with a much larger world
size?
  
**Example Program Run**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please Input Coordinates: 4, 2

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closest Events to (4, 2):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event 003 - $30.29, Distance 3   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event 001 - $35.20, Distance 5  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event 006 - $01.40, Distance 9  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event 009 - $01.40, Distance 10  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event 004 - $01.40, Distance 16
